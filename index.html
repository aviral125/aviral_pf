        Cars were introduced to as a means to make the commute shorter, but the increase in cars in past decade has itself become an obstruction. Constant traffic jams have significantly reduced the effectiveness of cars and the cars themselves have become a major contributor of pollution. The need of alternate transportation in cities is a necessity now more than ever. In past year, the concept of bike sharing has come come out on the top as an alternative transportation in cities with major traffic and pollution problems.

        1. Preliminary Research
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        For preliminary research I did extensive reading on existing bike sharing companies and the impact they have had in the operating area. Most of the bikes are rented on such platforms are for small distances that are too far to walk and too near for car. This reading provoded me with fairly good idea of possible customer types for this service, below are some of the major customers type.
      </p>
      <p class="head1" style="margin-top: 40px;">USERS</p>
      <p class="content">
        Adults to aged-people who need bikes for small commute.
      </p>
      <p class="head1" style="margin-top: 40px;">USER TYPE EXAMPLES</p>
      <ul class="normal">
        <li>Adults who need to commute on short distance daily</li>
        <li>People who are bicycle enthusiast</li>
        <li>College students commuting from home to college</li>
        <li>Working adult ~25, commuting from work to home</li>
        <li>People going from metro to apartments or vice versa</li>
        <li>People going from shopping complex to metro station</li>
        <li>People shifting to a healthy lifestyle</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="italics">
        Most of these user types can be categorised into two categories i.e. commuters and people who use bikes for exercise.

        2. Defining Product
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        This application should help user find a bike in his/her vicinity and provide directions to the same. It should guide user through the steps and help him obtain a better understanding of the functioning with time.
      </br><br>
        There are two kinds bike sharing i.e. dock bike or deck-less bike, dock-less bike can be dropped anywhere and requires the founding company to have a huge requirement, whereas bikes with dock stations can be tested and introduced in limited area. For this case study I am assuming the bikes to be dock-less that can be left and picked up from anywhere.
      </p>
      <p class="head1" style="margin-top: 40px;">HOW I WANT THE PRODUCT TO BEHAVE/DESIGN PRINCIPLES</p>
      <p class="content">
        <ul class="numbered">
          <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Utilitarian:</span> User views his devices as tools, not toys. The app should reflect that.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Anticipate, don’t ask:</span> User is tired of micromanaging his tech. Our app works for the user, not the reverse.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Accessible on the go:</span> User is always on the go. The app accounts for divided attention.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Honest:</span> The design should not act more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Adaptable:</span> Interface should guide the user and grow with user’s familiarity.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="head1" style="margin-top: 40px;">THINGS I WANT USER TO BE ABLE TO DO WITH THIS APP

        <ul class="numbered fix">
          <li>Quickly search for bikes in your vicinity</li>
          <li>Easily navigate the path to bike location</li>

      3. Understanding users and user types
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      Commuters are of different types, each with different set of needs and expectation from this application, I have categorised the users based on the frequency with which they use/engage with the product.

      Categorising users based on frequency of use provides insights into user needs and expectation but it doesn’t tell much about how users will interact with the product, and to know the same categorisation based on familiarity/competence with the application.
    </br></br>
      As discussed above I wanted the application to be able to guide users and grow with user’s familiarity with the app, and inorder to do so, first realisation of what these user type want and know is crucial.
    </p>

    <p class="head1" style="margin-top: 40px;">USER TYPE BASED ON FAMILIARITY
      <ul class="numbered fix text" style="width:50%">
        <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Beginner/new user:</span> These users can easily follow the steps involved in the
process, but do not know the possible errors that may arise and how to tackle
them, they rely on the app navigation to find their way throught and rarely use
and shortcuts.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Intermediate users:</span> These users know their way around the app and are
somewhat familiar with the shortcuts. </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Advance users:</span> These people are familiar with the application and use it more
than a mode of transportation, these users keep track of their trips and know
about their calorie consumption.</li>
      </ul>

    <span style="margin-top:20px;"><i>The aim is to convert new users to intermediate users and help intermediate users become more efficient with the app</i>

      4. Mapping User Journey
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      With basic process in place I mapped out user journey for usertypes based on Familiarity, for this step I considered user’s needs and expectations of each user type to properly plan the process.

    <p class="head1" style="margin-top: 40px;">BEGINNER/NEW USER JOURNEY</p>

    <p class="content">
      For new user the journey both inside and outside the app is preety straightforward, starting from bike navigation to final payment successful screen. Each step guides the user to the next and when he/she becomes familiar, app presents users with shortcut tips to convert the user from beginner to intermediate.

      5. Information Architecture
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      After finalising the steps involved in the user journey, I advanced to make an Information architecture that takes into account the individual step importance and provide an experience that matches the user mental model as closely as possible.
    </br></br>
      This part was especially simple as most of the steps could be accessed only after the user has visited the previous screens and the IA for beginner user type is more or less same as the user journey provided in last step.
      </br></br>
      I listed individual steps for each user types against their importance to respective users, this part was all about comparing steps importance and clubbing features similar in functioning.
      </br></br>
      This is the Information architecture this application is designed on

      6. Converting concepts into UI
    </p>
    <p class="content">
With IA in place, I started working on the information and features that will be presented to user on each screen.       </br></br>
For this task I listed down all possible actions I want user to be able to do on this page,  then I mapped information/features that user will require to do those actions, this mapping is compared with user mental modal(what all he knows at this point, how does he feal after the last step) to see how to present information to get the best results.      </br></br>
After mapping out features for each screen, I began creating rough sketches of primary screens and to avoid blocking myself later in process, I tried to work on creating a design system, not a single screen in the early stages of wireframing. The goal was to minimize watch interaction and make important information easy to access.       </br></br>
    </p>

    </div>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="wrapper-150">
  <p class="content" style="margin-top: 120px;">
    From all wireframes, I selected two designs that I felt were closest to the experience I wanted to provide, for each screen.
  </br></br>
    I started designing elements from selected wireframe in sketch, for each element I designed numerous variations and after multiple iterations when I had something I was happy with I moved to bigger element.

</div>

<div class="wrapper-150">
  <p class="content" style="margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom:80px;">
After getting some idea of the kind of UI I want for this design, I did various explorations to get to as close to it as possible, for every screen I already had decided the features and arranged them in order of relevance.

<div class="wrapper-150">

      <li>Bike details(distance and location)</li>
      <li>Book bike and Navigate bike button</li>

  </div>
  <p class="content" style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom:30px;">
    Right from the start all the iterations done were based on the hierarchy above, the same can be seen in some of the early designs.
    <i><br><br>Some early designs(more to less developed from left to right)</i>

</div>

<div class="wrapper-150">
  <p class="content" style="margin-top: 120px; margin-bottom:40px;">
    After deciding on the above screen as the final design, I wanted to test how it puts up with real users. To do a little user testing, I created a marvel prototype and showed it to couple of friends of mine. The testing clearly showed that there were several problems with the current design and more work was needed to be done
  </p>

  <p class="head1" style="margin-top: 80px;">Major problems found during user testing</p>
  <ul class="normal">
    <li>Bike details are not displayed properly</li>
    <li>Navigate to bike button needs to stand out more</li>
    <li>Bike details carousel is not intutive at all</li>
    <li>Map markers don’t look like buttons</li>

      <p class="content" style="margin-top: 30px; width: 95%;">
        After considering all the problems that arose during user testing, I tweaked UI elements to make the features and important information more recognisable. In this design user does not get distracted from navigation bar and bike location markers themselves act like links to particular bike.

      7. Optimising UI and improving experience
    </p>
    <p class="content" style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:-10px;">
      While designing this app I had two goals for this design:
    </p>
    <ul class="numbered fix text2" style="width:70%; margin-left: 12px; margin-top:10px; opacity:1">
      <li><span style="opacity:.6;">The application should serve both new user and intermediate user, even if the
application is guide user at every step </span>there should be shortcuts available for
power users<span style="opacity:.6;">(intermediate users in this case) and user journey should become
shorter with every shortcut.</span></li>
      <li><span style="opacity:.6;">It should guide new user throught the steps involved and help him/her get more
effective at using the app. The design should contribute in </span>converting
beginner/new user to intermediate user without obstructing the primiary goal.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr class="midline" style="margin-top: 60px;">
    <p class="head1" style="margin-top: 90px;">IMPROVING INTERMEDIATE USER'S EXPERIENCE</p>
    <p class="content" style="margin-top: 35px; ">Intermediate users are already aware of app’s basic functioning and don’t need to be guided around the app, what these users need is to be able to use the application more effectively and getting done more in lesser time.</p>
    <p class="content" style="margin-top: 35px; opacity:1; margin-bottom:-6px;">Two techniques are to be implemented to siginficantly reduce the time spent on app.</p>
    <ul class="numbered fix text2" style="width:70%; margin-left: 12px;">
      <li>Manually locking the bike automatically ends the trip, this way user can simply hop off the bike lock the bike and walk off. This saves the time spent in ending trip through the phone, and at the same time reduce the dependency of mobile on the system.</li>
      <li>Intermediate users knows where the bikes are mostly parked, both near their office and home, and they don’t need navigation for something they already know. Providing access to QR code scanner right on navigation bar requires the steps involved in unlocking a bike.  </li>
    </ul>

        <p class="content" style="opacity:1; width: 90%;">Among all the steps involved in the process of bike sharing, payment consumes time the most,<span style="opacity: 0.7;"> and when not done right after ending a trip(which is bad expectations) it becomes a nuisance at the time of next use.</span></p>
        <p class="content" style="opacity:1; width: 90%;">An option to get monthly subscription should be offered to users who need the service on once or twice a day. One time subscription removes the payment step from the process making it more streamline.</p>

      <hr class="midline" style="margin-top: 100px;">
      <p class="content" style="opacity:1; margin-top:100px; margin-bottom:60px;">Integration of above mentioned features into the application significantly cuts down steps involved in user journey, making the application more efficient.</p>

    <p class="content" style="opacity:.6; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
      New user may not be aware of advance functionalities such as manually locking the bike automatically ends the trip, so first few times he/she will use the app to end trip. But, after first few uses when user has basic understanding of the process, he/she can be exposed to more advance features.
      </br></br>
      These ‘Tips’ should be presented in a manner that does interface with the primary steps that users are already familiar with.

        <p class="content" style="opacity:1; width: 80%; margin-top: 160px;">
          On Trip start page, that comes just after user scans the
          barcode to unloack bike, user can be informed of the QR
          scanner shortcut present in navigation bar. This way user will
          directly be able to identify this shortcut’s advantages as they
          just went through the longer process.

        <p class="content" style="opacity:1; width: 80%; margin-top: 240px;">Even when ending trip with phone users must have noticed the bike lock’s automatic locking mechanism. On payment screen that comes after ending trip, user can be introduced to ending trip by manually locking the bike. This approach does not interfere with the ongoing process and when consumed helps user engage with the app more effictively.

        <ul class="normal spacing" style="width:50%; margin-left: 12px; margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:240px;">
          <li>Doing extensive user research assists in taking better design decisions at every step of the process.</li>
          <li>Advancing to UI without investing sufficient time in wireframes, slows the designs later in process and can lead to designing the screen again.</li>
          <li>Doing even the basic user testing early on in the process benefits a lot.</li>
        </ul>
